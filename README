django-multimedia

django-multimedia is a super simple, reusable Django 1.0 application for managing media
files. Currently, it supports image files (JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and GIF); audio and
video files are planned. It doesn't do much, but I find it useful for managing images
on a blog.

Quick introduction
==================

Once installed, you upload media using the Django admin interface. To insert a
thumbnail in a template:

  {% thumbnail 15 with format=600x400,round=10 %}
  
...which looks up the image with id=15, creates a 600x400 max thumbnail with rounded
corners of radius 10 (if it doesn't already exist), and outputs an HTML <img> tag.

The 'format' is shorthand for the look of a thumbnail image. Here are the currently
supported options:

  [width]x[height]          thumbnail width and height
  square or !square         crop image to a square or not
  round=[n]                 round corners, where n is radius in pixels
  bg=[color]                background color for the empty space that's created when
                            an image is rounded (e.g., 'ff0000')
  template=[template]       Django template used to render the image

A format can be specified inline, like the above example, or you can name a format
and refer to it. Here's an example:

  ...in your settings.py:
  
  MULTIMEDIA_FORMATS = [
    'blog': '600x400,round=10,bg=ffffff,template=blog_image.html',
    'mini': '200x200,square,round=5,bg=ffffff'
  ]
  
  ...in your templates:
  
  {% thumbnail 43 format=blog %}
  
  {% thumbnail 44 format=mini %}
